## What is it?
Smite is a paper plugin that adds a `/smite` command and give you the power of lightning!

<br>

## The smite command
**Usage: `/smite <@a/player> [power]`**
- Using the command without specifying a player will smite the location you are looking at.
- Using the command with `@a` will smite everyone online.
- Using the command with a `player` will smite that player.
- `[power]` is number you can enter that will determine how strong the lightning bold will be, and how much demage it deals.

<br>

## Permissions
To use the `/smite` command you need the `smite.command.smite` permission or to be OP.
